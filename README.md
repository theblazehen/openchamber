# OpenChamber

Web and desktop interface for the [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) AI coding agent. Works alongside the OpenCode TUI.

The OpenCode team is actively working on their own desktop app. I still decided to release this project as a fan-made alternative.

It was entirely built with OpenCode tool - first with the TUI version, then with the first usable version of OpenChamber, which I then used to build the rest.

The whole project was built entirely with AI coding agents under my supervision. It started as a hobby project and proof of concept that AI agents can create genuinely usable software.

## Why use OpenChamber?

- **Cross-device continuity**: Start in TUI, continue on tablet/phone, return to terminal - same session
- **Remote access**: Use OpenCode from anywhere via browser
- **Familiarity**: A visual alternative for developers who prefer GUI workflows

## Features

- Integrated terminal
- Git operations with identity management and AI commit message generation
- Beautiful themes (Flexoki Light/Dark) with dynamic CSS variable system
- Mobile-optimized with edge-swipe gestures, terminal control and optimizations all around
- Git worktrees operations with isolating sessions within them
- Memory optimizations with LRU eviction
- Rich permission cards with syntax-highlighted operation previews
- Smart tool visualization (inline diffs, file trees, results highlighting)
- Per-agent permission mode control (ask, allow, full) adjustable per-session
- Familiar diff viewer like you're used to in VSCode
- Built-in OpenCode agent/command management
