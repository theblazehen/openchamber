# OpenChamber

Web and desktop interface for the [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) AI coding agent. Works alongside the OpenCode TUI.

The OpenCode team is actively working on their own desktop app. I still decided to release this project as a fan-made alternative.

It was entirely built with OpenCode tool - first with the TUI version, then with the first usable version of OpenChamber, which I then used to build the rest.

The whole project was built entirely with AI coding agents under my supervision. It started as a hobby project and proof of concept that AI agents can create genuinely usable software.
